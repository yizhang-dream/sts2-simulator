# Parity Coverage Backlog

This document inventories the gameplay surfaces that still lack direct parity proof against the decompiled Slay the Spire 2 logic.

It complements [PARITY_GAPS.md](./PARITY_GAPS.md):

- `PARITY_GAPS.md` answers "why can we not yet claim exact parity?"
- this document answers "which card / relic / event surfaces still lack direct coverage?"

Absence from this document's covered lists is not proof of a bug. It means the repository does not yet have strong, targeted proof for that surface.

## Post-Agent Updates

The detailed backlog sections below were captured as the pre-pass baseline. After the latest local coverage passes, the stricter direct-reference audit including deprecated save placeholders reports:

| Surface | Total | Missing implementation references | Missing direct test references |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cards | 577 | 0 | 0 |
| Encounters | 88 | 0 | 0 |
| Events | 68 | 0 | 0 |
| Modifiers | 17 | 0 | 0 |
| Monsters | 121 | 0 | 0 |
| Potions | 64 | 0 | 0 |
| Powers | 260 | 0 | 0 |
| Relics | 290 | 0 | 0 |

This table is a coverage gate, not a full behavior proof. It means every reference surface counted by the maintainer-environment source-level parity audit has a Python implementation mention and a direct test mention. Exact parity still depends on the deeper behavior and bridge validation tracked in [PARITY_GAPS.md](./PARITY_GAPS.md).

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `BALL_LIGHTNING`, `BARRAGE`, `BEAM_CELL`, `COLD_SNAP`, `COMPILE_DRIVER`

No new logic mismatch was found in this pass. The pass also made these Defect card factories accept `upgraded=True` directly, so upgraded parity tests can use the semantic factory names.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `FIGHT_THROUGH`, `ICE_LANCE`, `REFRACT`

No new logic mismatch was found in this pass. The pass also made these card factories accept `upgraded=True` directly, so upgraded parity tests no longer need to route through `create_card`.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `DEATHS_DOOR`, `NEUROSURGE`, `SENTRY_MODE`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatches:

- `DeathsDoor`: reference-backed cards now expose the `Repeat` value through the effect field used by the Python implementation, so the repeat count is no longer an implicit fallback.
- `Neurosurge`: `NeurosurgePower` now maps into the effect field used by the Python implementation, so upgraded cards keep the original 3-power amount while only increasing energy.
- `SentryMode`: `SentryModePower` now maps into the effect field used by the Python implementation, so upgraded cards keep the original 1-power amount while only reducing cost.

The same pass added `scripts/audit_card_effect_vars.py`, which checks that card effects do not read `effect_vars` keys absent from the base or upgraded factory output.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `PREP_TIME`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatch:

- `PrepTime`: upgraded reference-backed cards now map `PrepTimePower+2` into the effect field actually used by the Python implementation, so `PrepTime+` grants 6 next-turn Vigor instead of 4.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `AUTOMATION`, `KNOCKDOWN`, `ROLLING_BOULDER`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatches:

- `Knockdown`: upgraded reference-backed cards now map `KnockdownPower+1` into the effect field actually used by the Python implementation, so `Knockdown+` applies multiplier 3 instead of 2.
- `RollingBoulder`: upgraded reference-backed cards now map `RollingBoulderPower+5` into the effect field actually used by the Python implementation, so `RollingBoulder+` starts at 10 damage instead of 5.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `ANOINTED`

No new logic mismatch was found in this pass.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `GANG_UP`

No new logic mismatch was found in this pass.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `HIDDEN_GEM`, `HUDDLE_UP`, `IMPATIENCE`, `SCRAWL`

No new logic mismatch was found in this pass.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Relics: `BLOOD_SOAKED_ROSE`, `ELECTRIC_SHRYMP`, `GNARLED_HAMMER`, `GOLDEN_PEARL`, `IRON_CLUB`, `LOOMING_FRUIT`, `MEAT_CLEAVER`, `NEOWS_TORMENT`, `NUTRITIOUS_OYSTER`, `PAELS_HORN`, `RINGING_TRIANGLE`, `SCREAMING_FLAGON`, `SLING_OF_COURAGE`, `TANXS_WHISTLE`, `VERY_HOT_COCOA`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatch:

- `MeatCleaver`: rest sites now show `Cook` even when fewer than two cards can be removed, with the option disabled, matching the original `CookRestSiteOption` behavior.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `CALTROPS`, `ENTRENCH`, `OUTMANEUVER`, `RELAX`, `WHISTLE`

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `BURY`, `CALCIFY_CARD`, `DEFY`, `DEMESNE`, `DEVOUR_LIFE_CARD`, `LETHALITY_CARD`, `SCOURGE`, `SHARED_FATE`, `SQUEEZE`, `TIMES_UP`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatch:

- OstyAttack cards: missing Osty now blocks only `HighFive`; other Osty attack cards remain playable and simply do nothing, matching the original card-specific `IsPlayable` behavior.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `CELESTIAL_MIGHT`, `CRESCENT_SPEAR`, `DEVASTATE`, `GAMMA_BLAST`, `GLITTERSTREAM`, `HEGEMONY`, `KNOW_THY_PLACE`, `LUNAR_BLAST`, `NEUTRON_AEGIS`, `PROPHESIZE`, `THE_SEALED_THRONE`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatch:

- `Glitterstream`: its `BlockNextTurn` amount now exists in the card factory and goes through the normal block modifier pipeline before applying.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `CATASTROPHE`, `ETERNAL_ARMOR`, `JACKPOT`, `PREP_TIME`, `PROWESS`, `SALVO`

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `BOOT_SEQUENCE`, `BULK_UP`, `DOUBLE_ENERGY`, `FUSION`, `GLASSWORK`, `LEAP`, `METEOR_STRIKE`, `MODDED`, `QUADCAST`, `SHADOW_SHIELD`, `SKIM`, `SYNTHESIS`, `UPROAR`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatch:

- `Quadcast`: it now triggers the front orb three times without removing it, then removes it on the fourth evoke, matching the original.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `ADAPTIVE_STRIKE`, `HELIX_DRILL`, `MOMENTUM_STRIKE`, `TESLA_COIL`, `VOLTAIC`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatches:

- `AdaptiveStrike`: after dealing damage, it now adds a 0-cost copy of itself to the discard pile.
- `HelixDrill`: hit count now follows energy spent by the owner this turn, excluding the card's own cost while it is in play.
- `MomentumStrike`: after dealing damage, it now sets its own cost to 0 for the rest of combat.
- `TeslaCoil`: after its attack, it now triggers only Lightning orb passives against the card target instead of triggering every orb passive.
- `Voltaic`: channel count now follows the owner's Lightning channel history for the combat rather than current orb count.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `ABRASIVE`, `ASSASSINATE`, `BOUNCING_FLASK`, `DASH`, `FLECHETTES`, `FLICK_FLACK`, `LEADING_STRIKE`, `MIRAGE`, `PREDATOR`, `RICOCHET`, `SHADOWMELD`, `SUPPRESS`, `UNTOUCHABLE`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatch:

- `Ricochet`: base and upgraded hit counts now match the original 4 / 5 hits instead of being one hit short.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `PILLAGE`, `PYRE`, `STAMPEDE_CARD`, `STONE_ARMOR`, `TAUNT`, `TREMBLE`, `UNMOVABLE`, `UNRELENTING`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatches:

- `Pillage`: continuation now uses the actual card returned by the draw command, so draw-time effects that move an Attack out of hand, such as `Hellraiser`, do not stop the draw loop early.
- `Unmovable`: block doubling now applies to the owner's own card / move block and no longer doubles another player's card block.

Latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `BARRICADE_CARD`, `BEACON_OF_HOPE`, `BLUDGEON`, `CORRUPTION_CARD`, `DEMON_FORM_CARD`, `DEMONIC_SHIELD`, `FISTICUFFS`, `FLAME_BARRIER_CARD`, `GOLD_AXE`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatch:

- `DemonicShield`: block granted to an ally now fires after-block-gained hooks for that ally, so follow-up effects like `BeaconOfHope` run like the original.
- `Fisticuffs`: block gained from attack damage now goes through the normal block modifier pipeline, so Dexterity, Frail, and similar block modifiers apply like the original.
- Colorless block cards now fire the after-block-gained hook, so `BeaconOfHope` shares block from `Finesse` and `Fisticuffs` like the original.

Previous local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Relics: `EMOTION_CHIP`, `GAMBLING_CHIP`, `GIRYA`, `JUZU_BRACELET`, `KUNAI`, `PAPER_KRANE`, `SHOVEL`, `SHURIKEN`, `SNECKO_SKULL`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatches:

- `JuzuBracelet`: unknown rooms now blacklist `Monster` outcomes when resolving `?` rooms.
- `SneckoSkull`: the relic now participates in the power-amount-given pipeline, so owner-applied Poison correctly gains `+1`.
- `Girya`: after 3 lifts, the rest site no longer keeps surfacing `Lift`.
- `EmotionChip`: now tracks previous-round unblocked HP loss and re-triggers all orb passives on the next player turn.
- `GamblingChip`: round-1 discard-and-draw now uses a real pending hand-choice flow.
- `PaperKrane`: Weak damage reduction now matches the original multiplier path without float-floor drift.

The latest local pass also added direct coverage for:

- Relics: `CLOAK_CLASP`, `GHOST_SEED`, `INTIMIDATING_HELMET`, `IVORY_TILE`, `MEAT_ON_THE_BONE`, `POWER_CELL`, `RAINBOW_RING`, `RAZOR_TOOTH`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatches:

- `GhostSeed`: starter `Strike` / `Defend` cards now actually gain `Ethereal` when combat starts.
- `RainbowRing`: it now only grants its `+1 Strength / +1 Dexterity` payoff once per turn.
- `RazorTooth`: played Attack / Skill cards now upgrade through the real combat upgrade path instead of calling a nonexistent card method.

This pass added direct coverage for:

- Cards: `ARMAMENTS`, `BURNING_PACT`, `HEADBUTT`, `TRUE_GRIT`, `WHIRLWIND`, `BACKSTAB`, `BLADE_DANCE`, `BURST`, `ESCAPE_PLAN`, `WRAITH_FORM`, `CHARGE_BATTERY`, `COOLHEADED`, `DUALCAST`, `LOOP_CARD`, `SUNDER`, `MASTER_OF_STRATEGY`, `MIND_BLAST`, `PANACHE_CARD`, `MIMIC`, `VOLLEY`, `GATHER_LIGHT`, `GLOW`, `MAKE_IT_SO`, `RADIATE`, `STARDUST`, `DRAIN_POWER`, `END_OF_DAYS`, `GLIMPSE_BEYOND`, `SEVERANCE`, `SOUL_STORM`, `BURN`, `VOID`, `REGRET`, `DEBT`, `FRANTIC_ESCAPE`, `NORMALITY`
- Events: `BrainLeech`, `RoomFullOfCheese`, `TeaMaster`, `Neow`, `WarHistorianRepy`, `DeprecatedEvent`, `DeprecatedAncientEvent`, `RelicTrader`, `SlipperyBridge`, `Symbiote`, `LostWisp`, `Reflections`, `TheLegendsWereTrue`, `SpiralingWhirlpool`, `StoneOfAllTime`, `TheFutureOfPotions`, `WaterloggedScriptorium`, `DrowningBeacon`, `GraveOfTheForgotten`, `HungryForMushrooms`, `InfestedAutomaton`, `SunkenStatue`, `TheArchitect`, `CrystalSphere`, `EndlessConveyor`, `FakeMerchant`, `WelcomeToWongos`, `FieldOfManSizedHoles`, `ColorfulPhilosophers`, `SunkenTreasury`, `TabletOfTruth`, `ThisOrThat`, `Wellspring`, `DollRoom`, `AbyssalBaths`, `Amalgamator`, `AromaOfChaos`, `ByrdonisNest`, `Orobas`, `SapphireSeed`, `SelfHelpBook`, `WoodCarvings`, `ZenWeaver`

This pass also exposed and fixed the following logic mismatches:

- `Escape Plan`: now draws first and only grants block if the drawn card is a Skill.
- `Dualcast`: now evokes the front orb twice with the correct first-without-dequeue / second-with-dequeue behavior.
- `Coolheaded`: now channels Frost before drawing.
- `Chemical X`: now feeds its X-value bonus into the engine's `energy_spent` path.
- `Gremlin Horn`: now actually triggers on enemy death and grants energy + draw.
- `SlipperyBridge.overcome`: now actually removes one random removable card.
- `Symbiote.kill_fire`: now uses a real pending card choice and transforms one selected card.
- `TheLegendsWereTrue.nab_map`: now actually adds `Spoils Map`; `find_exit` now returns a potion reward object.
- `TheFutureOfPotions`: now trades the selected potion and produces upgraded card rewards with rarity / type mapping.
- `WaterloggedScriptorium`: now handles sparse or empty enchant candidates without deadlocking the choice flow.
- `CrystalSphere.debt`: now actually adds `Debt` to the deck.
- `FieldOfManSizedHoles`: now has real gating, `resist` removal + `Normality`, and `enter` enchant choice flow.
- `WelcomeToWongos`: purchases now grant relics; `leave` now downgrades a random upgraded card.
- `DrowningBeacon.climb`: now actually grants `Fresnel Lens`.
- `GraveOfTheForgotten`: now actually adds `Decay` and applies the `Soul's Power` enchantment choice.
- `HungryForMushrooms`: `fragrant` no longer double-applies HP loss.
- `InfestedAutomaton`: now actually adds a random Power or a random 0-cost non-X card.
- `SunkenStatue.grab_sword`: now actually grants `Sword of Stone`.
- `TabletOfTruth`: `give_up` no longer heals, and `decipher` now performs the staged upgrades.
- `JossPaper`: now tracks exhausts per owner correctly and resolves ethereal-turn-end draw timing.
- `Kusarigama`, `ParryingShield`, and `Tingsha`: now use a valid random-enemy selector.
- `GoldPlatedCables`, `PaperPhrog`, and `PetrifiedToad`: now follow their intended uncommon-relic combat semantics.
- `CursedPearl`: deferred follow-up mode now queues only the curse while granting gold immediately.
- `MummifiedHand`: now applies temporary cost-0 without calling a nonexistent combat API.
- `HandDrill`: now detects real block breaks and applies Vulnerable correctly.
- `BeltBuckle`: now checks actual held potions from combat player state.
- `BurningSticks`: now uses a supported hand-clone path.
- `RunicCapacitor`: now falls back to orb-queue capacity when slot APIs are absent.
- `UnceasingTop`: no longer depends on missing `combat.in_play_phase`.
- `Reflections.touch`: now actually downgrades 2 upgraded cards and upgrades 4 other cards.
- `Reflections.shatter`: now duplicates the deck and adds `Bad Luck`.

Previously scoped blocker `NORMALITY` is now closed:

- `NORMALITY` is now enforced in `CombatState.can_play_card`, and has direct parity coverage in `tests/test_status_curse_card_effects_parity.py`.

  - Result: `270 passed in 0.29s`

## Counting Rules

### Cards

- Card totals come from the lazy registry returned by `sts2_env.cards.factory._factory_registry()`.
- This is stricter and broader than counting handwritten `make_*` functions because it also includes reference-backed cards exposed through the factory.
- A card is counted as "explicitly parity-covered" only if it appears in a targeted parity suite or in a decompiled-backed test docstring.

### Relics

- A relic is counted as "directly test-touched" if a test references it via:
  - `obtain_relic("...")`
  - `create_relic_by_name("...")`
  - `relics=[...]` when constructing combat state
- This is intentionally conservative. Indirect behavior might still be exercised elsewhere, but it is not counted unless the relic is named directly by a focused test.

### Events

- An event is counted as "directly covered" only if a focused event test instantiates it or drives it through `RunManager`.
- Generic run-flow tests are not counted unless the event itself is named.

## Summary

| Surface | Total | Directly Covered | Gap | Coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cards | 578 | 83 | 495 | 14.4% |
| Relics | 289 | 73 | 216 | 25.3% |
| Events | 68 | 12 | 56 | 17.6% |

## What This Means

The repository has meaningful parity depth in several targeted areas:

- combat turn flow and hook semantics
- card choice flows
- Regent and Necrobinder spot checks
- potion action decoding
- reward / shop / rest-site relic plumbing

But the proof surface is still sparse relative to the total implementation surface:

- Ironclad has no explicit card-by-card parity suite yet
- Silent and Defect still only have a small targeted subset covered
- Status / curse / event / quest cards are mostly uncovered
- most relics still lack direct named tests
- most events still lack focused tests

## Current Direct Relic Coverage

The maintainer-environment source-level parity audit currently reports all 290 counted relic classes with implementation and direct-test references.

The older uncovered-relic buckets have been removed from this live backlog because they became stale after the focused relic parity suites were added. Relic exactness should still be judged by the behavior-specific tests and by the remaining exact-parity blockers in [PARITY_GAPS.md](./PARITY_GAPS.md), not by direct name coverage alone.

## Recommended Order For Closing The Remaining Risk

1. Keep using the direct-reference audit as the coverage gate before claiming a surface has no named gaps.
2. Expand behavior-specific tests when a decompiled hook has nontrivial timing, owner-scope, RNG, reward, shop, or bridge semantics.
3. After the Python-side proof surface stays green, re-run bridge replay and live smoke testing.

## Interpretation Guardrails

- This backlog is about missing proof, not necessarily missing implementation.
- A surface can be correctly implemented and still appear here.
- Exact parity should only be claimed once the proof surface is broad enough that remaining untested behavior is clearly unreachable or mechanically trivial.
